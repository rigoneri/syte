About Tumblr OAuth
Tumblr supports OAuth 1.0a, accepting parameters via the Authorization header, with the HMAC-SHA1 signature method only. There's probably already an OAuth client library for your platform. 

If you've worked with Twitter's OAuth implementation, you'll feel right at home with ours.
Request-token URL:
POST http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/request_token
Authorize URL:
http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/authorize
Access-token URL:
POST http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/access_token
xAuth
Web apps should use the standard OAuth flow, reserving xAuth for apps in which the web authorization process is impractical or impossible, such as native desktop or mobile apps. 

xAuth is not enabled by default. To request xAuth permission for your app, please use the Request xAuth link on an app above.
xAuth access-token URL:
POST https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/access_token
Accepts x_auth_username (the user's email address), x_auth_password, and x_auth_mode=client_auth, just like Twitter's implementation.
